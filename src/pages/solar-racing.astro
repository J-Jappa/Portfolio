    <h1>What is Solar Racing?</h1>
    <p>
      Solar racing is about building ultra-efficient, road-capable EVs that run
      primarily on sunlight. Teams push on aerodynamics, lightweight structures,
      solar array performance, battery management, and strategy to cover long
      distances on very little energy.

    <h2>The Bridgestone World Solar Challenge (BWSC)</h2>
    <p>
      The BWSC is the flagship event. The route is roughly 3,000 km from Darwin
      to Adelaide across Australia, and it is held every two years. Cars
      complete the route over several days, harvesting energy from the sun and
      managing a small battery buffer. There are two main classes: <em
        >Challenger</em
      > for single-seat, pure efficiency, and <em>Cruiser</em> for multi-occupant
      practicality with efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Brief history</h2>
    <p>
      In 1982 Hans Tholstrup and Larry Perkins drove the solar car
      <em>Quiet Achiever</em> across Australia from Perth to Sydney. It showed that
      long-distance solar travel is possible.
    </p>

      lightbox={true}
    />

    <p>
      In 1987 the first World Solar Challenge ran from Darwin to Adelaide. It
      has continued to evolve with new technology, tighter rules, and strong
      international fields every cycle. In 2025 the event brought with 34 teams
      from 18 countries.
    </p>

    <h2>How the BWSC runs</h2>
    <p>
      Each day runs on a simple rhythm: cars may drive from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.
      At 5:00 pm you stop where you are, pull off safely, and camp
      self-sufficiently by the highway. In the morning you line up again and
      roll at 8:00 am. That daily box defines almost every decision.
    </p>

    <h3>Control stops</h3>
    <p>
      The route has official control stops in towns and roadhouses. Every team
      must pull in and serve a 30 minute stop. For most of that time the car
      cannot be touched. These stops are where you reset, charge if the sun is
      good, and check everyone is coping.
    </p>

    <h3>Convoy on public roads</h3>
    <p>
      The solar car does not travel alone. There is a lead vehicle in front to
      scout traffic and hazards, the solar car in the middle, and a chase
      vehicle close behind that handles comms, telemetry and decisions. Teams
      also have logistics and media vehicles further back. Everything happens in
      live traffic, so you drive to the normal road rules and work with other
      road users. This includes hazrds such as cattle grids and massive road
      trains.
    </p>

    <h3>Race strategy in practice</h3>
    <p>
      Strategy is about turning weather, battery state, terrain and traffic into
      a target speeds for the car to finish in the least time possible. The
      chase car watches live telemetry, forecasts and road notes, then calls
      speeds to the driver and decides when to push, when to bank energy, and
      when to change drivers. At stops you point the array for the best light,
      tidy losses, and plan the next segment.
    </p>

    <h3>Nights in the bush</h3>
    <p>
      After 5:00 pm you camp where you stopped. The team uses the time to
      inspect fasteners, tyres, brakes and HV systems, log issues, and prepare
      for the next day. You also look after people: food, hydration, sleep, and
      a plan everyone understands before the morning roll-out.

    <h2>ANU Solar Racing</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>ANU Solar Racing</strong> is a student-run team from the Australian
      National University. We design, build, and race a solar car end to end, from
      concept and CAD through composites, electronics, testing, and race operations.
      This is done all while studying at uni. We bring as much technical work in-house
      as possible, including composites, solar encapsulation, battery, and machining,
      and we are active in outreach.
    </p>

    <h3>My role on the team</h3>
    <p>
      Our team cycles run for about two years. I have been part of two. I joined
      in 2022 on the Aerodynamics team. I learned the fundamentals, started new
      concepts, and made updates to the current car, SC3.
    </p>

    <Figure
      src="/images/solar/racing/sc3.jpg"
      alt="SC3"
      maxWidth="1100px"
      lightbox={true}
    />

    <p>
      Later I worked on battery cooling, helped with the solar array, and
      designed and manufactured a rotating wheel-fairing system. That iteration
      culminated in the 2023 BWSC.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the next cycle (2024 to 2025) I moved to Structures with responsibility
      for a new aerodynamic shell and a carbon-fibre chassis from scratch. I led
      the aero design. The regulations changed from 2023, so we committed to a
      very different concept. I then interfaced every subsystem into the carbon
      structure. I worked closely across the technical team to make the
      structure as efficient as possible. For the first time in team history we
      also brought a lot of carbon work in-house. I spent two intensive periods
      in Sydney laying up, ply by ply, from the aero shell through to secondary
      bonding for bulkheads.

    />

    <p>
      I also worked on hinges for driver egress and optimal charging, and
      transparent light covers for brake, indicator, and daytime running lights
      to meet regulations. On the race I was a strategist, working with the
      chase car to set optimal speeds and to manage difficult weather, including
      severe storms and strong winds.

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <p>
      The constraints of BWSC push extreme efficiency: less drag, less mass, and
      smarter controls. The lessons translate to real EVs and to lightweight
      engineering more broadly.
