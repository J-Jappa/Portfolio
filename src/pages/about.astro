    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I'm <strong>Jasper Japp</strong>, an Engineering (Honours) graduate from
      the <strong>Australian National University</strong> majoring in
      <strong>Electronics &amp; Communication Systems</strong> with a minor in
      <strong>Mechatronic Systems</strong>. I've spent the last few years working
      on aerodynamics, composite structures, embedded systems, and machine
      learning for sensing. What I enjoy most is turning complex, messy
      problems into clean designs that actually work in practice.

    <h2>What I've been working on</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ANU Solar Racing — Aerodynamics &amp; Structures:</strong> Shaped
        a low-drag catamaran body, automated CFD runs with Python, and
        manufactured a carbon-fibre car. Optimised the structural layout to
        integrate electrical and mechanical systems seamlessly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ANU Solar Racing — Mechanical Design:</strong> Designed four-bar
        linkage systems for driver egress and solar array tilting, balancing
        stiffness, packaging, and regulatory requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Early bushfire detection:</strong> Built machine learning
        pipelines (GRU/GMM-VAE and STFT-CNN variants) to detect fires from IoT
        sensor data, with a focus on reducing false positives.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outside of Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy making a really good cup of coffee, skiing when I can, and
      playing team sports. I'm always experimenting with new ways to bring
      projects to life and picking up new skills along the way, like building
      this website.
