    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Jasper Japp</strong>, a final-year Engineering (Honours)
      student at the
      <strong>Australian National University</strong>, majoring in
      <strong>Electronics &amp; Communication Systems</strong> with a minor in
      <strong>Mechatronic Systems</strong>. My work sits at the intersection of
      <strong>aerodynamics &amp; composites</strong>, <strong
        >embedded systems</strong
      >, and <strong>machine learning for sensing</strong>. I focus on turning
      complex, messy problems into clean, testable designs that work in
      practice.

    <h2>What I’m into</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>ANU Solar Racing — Aero &amp; Structures:</strong> shaped a low-drag
        catamaran body, automated Fluent runs with Python, and manufactured &amp;
        full carbon-fibre car and stucture. Optimised structrual layout with interfacing
        between all electrical and mechanical systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ANU Solar Racing — Mechanical Design:</strong> Designed four bar
        linkage systems for driver egress and for solar array tilting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Early bushfire detection:</strong> built a GRU/GMM-VAE and a hybrid
        STFT-CNN and GRU-VAE pipeline on eCO₂/TVOC streams and designed experiment-level
        decision rules.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tooling I reach for</h2>
    <p class="m-0">
      SolidWorks · ANSYS Fluent · Python (automation &amp; data) ·
      MATLAB/Simulink · microcontrollers · a lot of careful measurement.
    </p>

    <h2>Outside of Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy brewing a really good cup of coffee, skiing when I can, and
      playing team sports. I'm also always experimenting with new ways to bring
      various projects to life and learning new skills, like building this
      website.
