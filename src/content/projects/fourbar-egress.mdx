## Requirements

Fast egress, minimal intrusion into the airflow, and a path that does not chip the shell. I set the throw and link lengths to clear the canopy and land in a stable open position that is easy to handle in wind.

## Development


<ImageRow
  cols={3}
  images={[
    { src: "/images/solar/egress/1.jpg", alt: "CAD concept" },
    { src: "/images/solar/egress/2.jpg", alt: "Mock-up testing" },
    { src: "/images/solar/egress/3.jpg", alt: "Installed assembly" },
  ]}
/>

## Testing

We cycle tested the hinge and did timed egress checks. It stayed tight and predictable, and it did not mark the shell.
