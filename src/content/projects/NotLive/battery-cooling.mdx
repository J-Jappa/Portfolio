## Aim

Keep the pack safe and inside temperature limits with a system that is easy to service on the roadside. I kept the design simple and made sure it would pass inspection cleanly.

## Approach

I mapped heat paths and pressure losses, then picked a duct layout and fan spec that matched our space and power budgets. I sealed the obvious bypass paths and added simple gaskets where it mattered most. I put sensors on critical modules and at outlets so I could see the real delta during testing.

    { src: "/images/solar/battery/3.jpg", alt: "Pack assembly and sealing" },
  ]}
/>

## Results

Track testing showed stable temperatures with margin in hot conditions. The logs made it easy to see weak points and fix them. The pack stayed clean to assemble and simple to check overnight.
