New to Solar Racing? Read [What is Solar Racing?](/solar-racing/) for a quick overview. For how this interfaces to the car structure, see [Carbon Bulkheads and Interfacing](/projects/bulkheads-interfacing/). The motion concept follows the [Canopy Opening Mechanism for Driver Egress](/projects/fourbar-egress/).

## Requirements

Quick deploy, secure stays and safe handling in wind. Hinge axes were chosen to give useful tilt without fouling cables or the shell. Target opening was ~60° so early-morning and late-afternoon charging is worthwhile with our limited battery buffer.

## Design

The hinge is a compact four-bar. The geometry hits the 60° target while maintaining clearance to the shell and wiring. Tilting reduces array incidence to the sun, increasing collected power at low sun angles.

Top hinge mounts land on composite bulkheads bonded to the topshell. Bottom mounts pick up hard points on the main lower bulkheads. Space around the lower mounts is tight, so hardware is low-profile.

Support poles are 24 mm OD carbon-fibre tubes. Ends are machined aluminium with brass tophat bushings to reduce friction. Countersunk bolts avoid fouling in the narrow bay.

To bond inserts, grooves were machined into the aluminium to increase bond area. An aluminium plate jig kept the poles straight while the structural epoxy cured. Hole patterns were drilled with laser-cut acrylic jigs. Backing plates on the rear face of the top bulkheads distribute tension loads.

Two additional carbon poles act as stays to hold the array open at the desired angle.

## Materials and notes

- Four-bar links and mounts in aluminium with brass tophat bushings  
- 24 mm OD carbon-fibre tubes with bonded aluminium inserts  
- Structural epoxy with controlled bondline thickness and curing jigs  
- Laser-cut drill jigs for hole accuracy and repeatability  
- Low-profile, countersunk fasteners where clearances are tight  

## What I would refine next

- Add more adjustability to ensure first-install fitment  
- Add opening assistance (e.g., gas struts) for drivers at control stops  
- Install before the solar array is fitted to improve access and reduce shell mass during setup
