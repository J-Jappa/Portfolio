## Goals

Quick deploy, positive locks, and safe handling in wind. I picked hinge axes that give useful tilt without risking cables or skin contacts.

## Design

The hinge brackets land on reinforced inserts in the shell. The stand is light and nests in the car.

  ]}
/>

## Field use

At stops we set the angle, check cables and locks, and start data logging. The setup held up in gusty conditions and packed away cleanly.
