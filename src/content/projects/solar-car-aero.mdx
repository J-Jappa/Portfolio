## Design, Iteration, and Evaluation

The design process evolved through multiple approaches as both the _team’s skills_ and the _car’s maturity_ grew. All 3D aerodynamic analysis was carried out in _ANSYS Fluent_, totalling more than _1,000 computational hours_ and generating over _1.5 TB of data_. The solar car geometry was modelled in _SolidWorks_, with _64 distinct design iterations_ produced, along with countless incremental refinements. This intensive design period defined my work from _mid-February to early October 2024_.

#### Early Stages and Concept Evaluation

When the _2025 BWSC regulations_ were released, the overall concept of the car was still undecided. Drawing on past solar car designs and exploring new ideas, we developed four competing concepts as front runners:

    { src: "/images/solar/early/SLUG.PNG", alt: "Slug Concept" },
    { src: "/images/solar/early/TRI.PNG", alt: "Trimaran Concept" },
  ]}
/>

After comparative CFD runs and discussion, the _catamaran_ was chosen as the concept to develop into _ANU Solar Racing’s fourth competition car_.

#### Fine Tuning

From there, refinement was carried out through iterative CFD testing, adjusting domain setups, crosswind scenarios, and wheel configurations:

  ]}
/>

This stage focused on _drag reduction_, _crosswind stability_, and manufacturability, feeding directly into the final surface model.

## Manufacturing

The _plug/pattern_ and _moulds_ were machined and finished by _Sydney Composites_, where I then spent _six days a week for four weeks_ in their workshop laying up the full carbon body. We used _pre-impregnated carbon fibre (pre-preg)_, layering sheets of fibre pre-impregnated with resin before curing in an oven under vacuum.

Three main types of core material were integrated:

- _Nomex honeycomb_ — for stiffness and lightweight sandwich structures
- _Corecell foam_ — for impact resistance in high-load regions
- _Soric_ — for areas requiring controlled resin flow and thickness

This period gave me _hands-on experience in advanced composites manufacturing_, and a deep appreciation for the constraints and decisions driven by real-world fabrication. Seeing the _finished carbon shell released from the mould_ was one of the most rewarding milestones of the project.

## Testing

Once the car reached consistent driving condition, I ran _constant-speed coast-down tests_ to determine its _drag coefficient (Cd)_. The measured value was within _10% of the CFD predictions_, validating both the fidelity of the aerodynamic design and the conservative approach taken in simulation.

The close match between simulation and reality is a testament to the effectiveness of the _design, manufacturing precision, and surface finish quality_.
