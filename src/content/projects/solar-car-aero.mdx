## Design, Iteration, and Evaluation

#### Early Stages and Concept evaluation

After the realses of the 2025 BWSC regulations, the concept of the car was up in the air. After consulting solar racing history and exploring new ideas, four varying concepts were developed as front runners.

The catamaran was chosen as the concept we would develop into ANU solar Racing's fourth car.
