## Scope and objectives

Create a low-drag, stable body that is manufacturable and serviceable.  
Hit energy and speed targets over the BWSC route.  
Build a workflow that links CAD, CFD and test.

## Concept selection

When the 2025 BWSC rules landed we explored multiple body concepts. I modelled and screened four options in CAD and CFD.

    { src: "/images/solar/early/MONO.PNG", alt: "Monohull",             caption: "Monohull baseline for comparison." },
    { src: "/images/solar/early/SLUG.PNG", alt: "Slug",                 caption: "Low-profile slug variant." },
    { src: "/images/solar/early/TRI.PNG",  alt: "Trimaran",             caption: "Trimaran with narrow centre body." },

/>

Comparative CFD and design reviews selected the catamaran as the best path.

## Refinement

I ran more than 1,000 compute hours in ANSYS Fluent and generated about 1.5 TB of data. I iterated domain setup, meshing, wheel treatments and crosswind studies. The CAD model in SolidWorks went through 64 major versions plus many small changes.

    { src: "/images/solar/domain/2.jpg", alt: "Top domain",             caption: "Planform domain for straight-ahead runs." },
    { src: "/images/solar/domain/3.jpg", alt: "Crosswind domain",       caption: "Crosswind domain for yaw sweeps." },
    { src: "/images/solar/domain/4.jpg", alt: "Wheel setup",            caption: "Wheel and ground-treatment sensitivity checks." },

The focus was drag reduction, crosswind stability and surfaces that can be built to tolerance.

## Manufacturing

Sydney Composites machined the plug and moulds. I spent four weeks in their workshop laying up the full carbon body, six days per week. We used pre-preg carbon cured under vacuum.

Core materials:

- Nomex honeycomb for stiffness at low mass  
- Corecell foam for impact resistance in local high loads  
- Soric where a controlled thickness and resin path helped

## Testing

Once the car was reliable on track I ran constant-speed tests to estimate drag. Measured drag was within 10% of CFD predictions.

The agreement between simulation and track testing supports the workflow and the build quality.

## Tools and methods

- SolidWorks for geometry, packaging and surface modelling  
- ANSYS Fluent for CFD  
- PyFluent API for scripting and run automation  
- Fluent adjoint solver to guide shape changes  
- JavaFoil for 2D airfoil evaluation tailored for ground effect

## What I would refine next

- Use a weighted CdA based on wind occurrence to balance straight-line and crosswinds  
- Tighter tolerances on solar-array packaging to reduce body size  
- Clearer link between yaw-stability targets and section shaping  
- More physical tests for crosswind sensitivity
