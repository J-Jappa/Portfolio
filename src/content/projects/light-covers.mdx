## Requirements

Meet visibility cones and brightness for indicators, brakes and DRLs.  
Keep covers sealed and smooth for low drag.  
Allow access for service without damaging the finish.

## Design

I shaped the covers in CAD to follow the shell and keep a clean aerodynamic profile. I first placed the lamps to satisfy the cone requirements, then designed the cover geometry and flanges around that.

I compared a few manufacturing options. The goal was high optical clarity so the lamps could stay compact without wasting power. The previous car used fibreglass covers that fit the carbon shell well but were opaque. I chose vacuum forming for cost, speed and clarity, then printed several forming tools to iterate.

Most covers formed cleanly over **male moulds** thanks to gentle curvature. The **two rear covers** were more complex and needed **female moulds**. I tuned the vacuum port sizes to avoid print-through while still pulling enough suction to form. Below are two tool approaches used on the rear left cover.

The rear left was difficult because of size and shape. A male draw thinned PETG too much and it lacked stiffness. The female approach uses two halves bonded together. The split line is less transparent than a single draw, but overall clarity is still a big improvement on the last iteration.

## Build

Covers are clear PETG, vacuum formed over printed tools. I trimmed to a scribe line, test fit on the shell, then sealed with a thin adhesive bead around the flange. I faired the outer edge into the surface with a small fillet of body filler, wet-sanded to a smooth transition, and wrapped over the area.

## Materials and notes

- PETG sheet, 1.0â€“2.0 mm depending on stiffness and curvature  
- Printed tooling with light draft and a smooth surface to avoid imprint  
- Clear structural adhesive on the flange with light clamping during cure  
- Small body-filler fillet to blend into the carbon shell, then wet-sand and wrap  
- Service access planned for lamp PCBs and cable runs

## What I would refine next

- Bond covers earlier in the build to allow more fairing time and a cleaner wrap finish  
- Use printed resin tools for the complex rear geometry to improve surface quality  
- Standardise access for PCB replacement and sealing checks
