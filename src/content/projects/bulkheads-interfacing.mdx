## Scope and constraints

The bulkheads are carbon-fibre sandwich panels that link the aerodynamic shell to every subsystem within the car. The goal was simple: clean load paths, minimal mass, and fast service on the side of the road. The constraints were the occupant cell and roll structure, the external aero-shell, and to have minimal impact to ideal subsystem packaging.

## Design and analysis

The bulkheads went through many iterations and started when the aerodynamic concept was selected. The early bulkhead designs served primarily to help subsystem design occur concurrently with the aero body design.

The bulkhead design was dictated by load paths from key systems such as the offset front right and left steering, the occupant cell, steering system and battery.

Several Full Assembly versions were issued using SolidWorks. These served to find, highlight, and solve interfacing problems. Once the aero body was complete and the design locked down, the bulkheads moved into a detailed design process. 

## Manufacturing and assembly

Bulkheads are carbon sandwich with local solid carbon in high load zones. We used secondary bonding to bring panels into the shell, then tied in seat mounts, pedal mounts, steering, pack, LV boxes, and array feedthroughs.
